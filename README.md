## Hiya!

I'm Luca, a software dev from England. Here you'll find rubbish code, and even more rubbish code. It's actually quite interesting how bad it is.

I am working on something called ReviewGuys - a site for Fall Guys which allows you to add levels and get them reviewed by other creators. It really shouldn't take over half a year, but I've restarted the frontend twice and changed my backend 3 times! (I now use ExpressJS on a Raspberry Pi).

I use Arch, btw
